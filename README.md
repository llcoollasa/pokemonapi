 ## Improvements/Time constraints

 - Detail Page UI/UX can be improve. Since there are more details available in current API call pokemon detail page can be organized with using pokemon other APIs such as ability, characteristic, gender etc. 
 - Pagination can be improved with adding first/last/prev/next links. Also as mentioned application can have endless scrolling.
 - Pagination uses state to display the result at the moment. In future it can be improved to go to specific page from the URL
 - Application wise general error handling can be use. Error component can be used in poperly through the app.
 - Intitial page could be combined with pokemon images and basic info
 - Enable query caching for app performance. Such as https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/caching
